                                     Cause . . . . . :   The access plan was rebuilt for reason code 4. The reason                  
                                       codes and their meanings follow: 0 - A new access plan was created. 1 - A                    
                                       file or member is not the same object as the one referred to in the access                   
                                       plan. Some reasons include the object being re-created, restored, or                         
                                       overriden to a new object. 2 - Access plan was using a reusable Open Data                    
                                       Path (ODP), and the optimizer chose to use a non-reusable ODP. 3 - Access                    
                                       plan was using a non-reusable Open Data Path (ODP) and the optimizer chose                   
                                       to use a reusable ODP. 4 - The number of records in member AARIUTPF1  of                     
                                       file AARIUTPF1  in library QTEMP      has changed by more than 10%. 5 - A                    
                                       new access path exists over member *N of file *N in library *N. 6 - An                       
                                       access path over member *N of file *N in library *N that was used for this                   
                                       access plan no longer exists or is no longer valid. 7 - The query access                     
                                       plan had to be rebuilt because of system programming changes. 8 - The CCSID                  
                                       (Coded Character Set Identifier) of the current job is different than the                    
                                       CCSID used in the access plan. 9 - The value of one of the following is                      
                                       different in the current job: date format, date separator, time format, or                   
                                       time separator. 10 - The sort sequence table specified has changed. 11 - The                 
                                       number of active processors or the size or paging option of the storage pool                 
                                       has changed. 12 - The system feature DB2 Symmetric Multiprocessing has                       
                                       either been installed or removed. 13 - The value of the degree query                         
                                       attribute has changed either by the CHGSYSVAL or CHGQRYA CL commands or with

                                     Cause . . . . . :   Bitmap processing was used to access records from member                   
                                       AARIUTPF1 of file AARIUTPF1 in library QTEMP. Bitmap processing is a method                  
                                       of allowing one or more access path(s) to be used to access the selected                     
                                       records from a file. Using bitmap processing, record selection is applied                    
                                       against each access path, similar to key row positioning, to create a                        
                                       bitmap. The bitmap has marked in it only the records of the file that are to                 
                                       be selected. If more than one access path is used, the resulting bitmaps are                 
                                       merged together using boolean logic. The resulting bitmap is then used to                    
                                       reduce access to just those records actually selected from the file. Bitmap                  
                                       processing is used in conjunction with the two primary access methods:                       
                                       arrival sequence (CPI4327 or CPI4329) or keyed access (CPI4326 or CPI4328).

                                       this message. When the bitmap is used with the keyed access method then it                   
                                       is used to further reduce the number of records selected by the primary                      
                                       access path before retrieving the selected records from the file. When the                   
                                       bitmap is used with arrival sequence then it allows the sequential scan of                   
                                       the file to skip records which are not selected by the bitmap. This is                       
                                       called skip sequential processing. The list below shows the names of the

                                       the library name that contains the query options file or create a duplicate                  
                                       object (CRTDUPOBJ command) of file QAQQINI from library QSYS into the                        
                                       specified library. 4 - Wait for lock on file QAQQINI in library QUSRSYS to                   
                                       be released and try the request again. 3, 5, or 6 - Delete query options                     
                                       file QAQQINI in library QUSRSYS and then duplicate it from QSYS. If the                      
                                       problem still persists, report the problem (ANZPRB command).
