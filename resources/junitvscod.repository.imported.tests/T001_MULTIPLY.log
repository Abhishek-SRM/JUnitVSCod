                                       improve the performance of the query if record selection is specified. If an                 
                                       access path does not exist, you may want to create one whose left-most key                   
                                       fields match fields in the record selection.  Matching more key fields in                    
                                       the access path with fields in the record selection will result in improved                  
                                       performance. Generally, to force the use of an existing access path, specify                 
                                       order by fields that match the left-most key fields of that access path. For

                                     Cause . . . . . :   Bitmap processing was used to access records from member                   
                                       AARIUTPF1 of file AARIUTPF1 in library QTEMP. Bitmap processing is a method                  
                                       of allowing one or more access path(s) to be used to access the selected                     
                                       records from a file. Using bitmap processing, record selection is applied                    
                                       against each access path, similar to key row positioning, to create a                        
                                       bitmap. The bitmap has marked in it only the records of the file that are to                 
                                       be selected. If more than one access path is used, the resulting bitmaps are                 
                                       merged together using boolean logic. The resulting bitmap is then used to                    
                                       reduce access to just those records actually selected from the file. Bitmap                  
                                       processing is used in conjunction with the two primary access methods:                       
                                       arrival sequence (CPI4327 or CPI4329) or keyed access (CPI4326 or CPI4328).                  
                                       The message that describes the primary access method immediately precedes                    
                                       this message. When the bitmap is used with the keyed access method then it                   
                                       is used to further reduce the number of records selected by the primary                      
                                       access path before retrieving the selected records from the file. When the                   
                                       bitmap is used with arrival sequence then it allows the sequential scan of                   
                                       the file to skip records which are not selected by the bitmap. This is                       
                                       called skip sequential processing. The list below shows the names of the                     
                                       access paths used in the bitmap processing: QTEMP/AARIUTPF1 If file                          
                                       AARIUTPF1 in library QTEMP is a logical file then member AARIUTPF1 of                        
                                       physical file AARIUTPF1 in library QTEMP is the actual file being accessed.

                                       their meanings follow: 1 - Library QUSRSYS was not found. 2 - File QAQQINI                   
                                       in library QUSRSYS was not found. 3 - The file was damaged. 4 - The file was                 
                                       locked by another process which prevented successful retrieval of the query                  
                                       options. 5 - File QAQQINI and the internal query options structures are out                  
                                       of sync. 6 - An unexpected error occurred while trying to retrieve the                       
                                       options file. The query options file is used by the Query Optimizer to                       
                                       determine how a query will be implemented. Recovery  . . . :   Default query                 
                                       options will be used, unless one of the following actions are taken, based                   
                                       on the reason code above. 1 - Either create the library (CRTLIB command) or                  
                                       correct the library name and then try the request again. 2 - Either specify                  
                                       the library name that contains the query options file or create a duplicate                  
                                       object (CRTDUPOBJ command) of file QAQQINI from library QSYS into the                        
                                       specified library. 4 - Wait for lock on file QAQQINI in library QUSRSYS to                   
                                       be released and try the request again. 3, 5, or 6 - Delete query options                     
                                       file QAQQINI in library QUSRSYS and then duplicate it from QSYS. If the                      
                                       problem still persists, report the problem (ANZPRB command).
