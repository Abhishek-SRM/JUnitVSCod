                                       improve the performance of the query if record selection is specified. If an                 
                                       access path does not exist, you may want to create one whose left-most key

                                       the access path with fields in the record selection will result in improved                  
                                       performance. Generally, to force the use of an existing access path, specify

                                     Cause . . . . . :   Bitmap processing was used to access records from member                   
                                       AARIUTPF1 of file AARIUTPF1 in library QTEMP. Bitmap processing is a method                  
                                       of allowing one or more access path(s) to be used to access the selected                     
                                       records from a file. Using bitmap processing, record selection is applied                    
                                       against each access path, similar to key row positioning, to create a                        
                                       bitmap. The bitmap has marked in it only the records of the file that are to                 
                                       be selected. If more than one access path is used, the resulting bitmaps are                 
                                       merged together using boolean logic. The resulting bitmap is then used to                    
                                       reduce access to just those records actually selected from the file. Bitmap                  
                                       processing is used in conjunction with the two primary access methods:                       
                                       arrival sequence (CPI4327 or CPI4329) or keyed access (CPI4326 or CPI4328).                  
                                       The message that describes the primary access method immediately precedes                    
                                       this message. When the bitmap is used with the keyed access method then it                   
                                       is used to further reduce the number of records selected by the primary                      
                                       access path before retrieving the selected records from the file. When the                   
                                       bitmap is used with arrival sequence then it allows the sequential scan of                   
                                       the file to skip records which are not selected by the bitmap. This is                       
                                       called skip sequential processing. The list below shows the names of the                     
                                       access paths used in the bitmap processing: QTEMP/AARIUTPF1 If file

                                       physical file AARIUTPF1 in library QTEMP is the actual file being accessed.
